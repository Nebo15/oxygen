# Oxygen

**Named GenServer**

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

  1. Add `oxygen` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:oxygen, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `oxygen` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:oxygen]]
    end
    ```
